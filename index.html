                <h3>What is Title Case?</h3>
                <dd>Title Case is a style where the first letter of most words in a sentence is capitalized. It is commonly used for titles of books, articles, and headlines. For example: "This Is a Title".</dd>

                <h3>What is Sentence case?</h3>
                <dd>Sentence case is the standard capitalization for sentences, where only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, along with any proper nouns. For example: "This is a sentence."</dd>

                <h3>What is camelCase?</h3>
                <dd>camelCase is a naming convention used primarily in programming for variables and functions. It combines multiple words into one, with the first letter of each word after the first being capitalized. For example: myVariableName.</dd>
